## Not finished yet! The are bugs -- do not build unless you're looking for a project.

The emberOne is a 100w open source ASIC Bitcoin mining hashboard.

- Separate control board required.
- Wide 12-14VDC input voltage.
- USB connection for data
  - Firware project for the onboard RP2040 usbserial converter: https://github.com/The-256-Foundation/ember-one-firmware

The emberOne 00 is based on the BM1362 from the Bitmain Antminer S19j Pro. It should reach about 3.5 TH/s

There will be more emberOne variants in the future using different ASICs
